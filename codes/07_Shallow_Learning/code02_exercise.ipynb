    "\n",
    "Think of it like **neighbors sharing information** in a social network:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Analogy:\n",
    "- Each **node** = a person in a neighborhood\n",
    "- Each **edge** = a connection between two people (friendship, relationship, etc.)\n",
    "- **Node features** = basic info about each person (age, income, etc.)\n",
    "- **Edge features** = info about the relationship (how close they are, how often they talk, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 (Message Function)**: \n",
    "- Each person sends a \"message\" to their neighbors\n",
    "- The message contains: \"Here's my current info (hj) and here's how strong our connection is (eji)\"\n",
    "- It's like saying: \"Hi neighbor, my current status is X, and our friendship strength is Y\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 (Reduce Function)**:\n",
    "- Each person collects ALL messages from their neighbors\n",
    "- They update their own info by combining:\n",
    "  - Their current info (hi)\n",
    "  - Weighted messages from neighbors (sum of eji * hj)\n",
    "- It's like saying: \"Based on what my neighbors told me, and considering how close I am to each of them, I'm updating my own status\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What's Really Happening:\n",
    "1. **Information Propagation**: Each node learns from its local neighborhood\n",
    "2. **Weighted Influence**: Closer neighbors (stronger edges) have more influence\n",
    "3. **Feature Enhancement**: Simple node features (like in-degree) become rich, context-aware features\n",
    "4. **Graph Structure Matters**: The network topology determines who influences whom\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Result:\n",
    "- Before: Each node only knew its own basic info (1D feature = in-degree)\n",
    "- After: Each node has a rich representation (100D feature) that captures both its own info AND its neighborhood context\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the foundation of **Graph Neural Networks** - allowing nodes to learn from their neighbors!"

    "# 1. Get current node features (what each node currently knows about itself)\n",

    "# 4. The magic happens here:\n",
